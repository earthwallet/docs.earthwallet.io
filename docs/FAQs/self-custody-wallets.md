# What is a self custody wallet?

A self-custody wallet is a place where you store digital money like cryptocurrency and other digital assets. Self-custody wallets, also called non-custodial wallets, are required to transact with blockchain-based financial applications, such as Uniswap and other DeFi applications. In these wallets you have access to your private keys and you are responsible for keeping them safe.
