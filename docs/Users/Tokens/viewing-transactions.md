4. After selecting a transaction you will be taken to the Etherscan (block explorer for Ethereum) page for that transaction, which gives you an overview of your transaction. It tells about when the transaction was executed, by whom it was executed, the value of ETH transferred and the transaction fee associated with that transaction.
