# Receiving NFTs

**To receive NFTs using Earth Wallet, follow these steps:**

1. For receiving NFTs you just need to share your wallet address with the sender.

2. To access your wallet address, go to your Earth Wallet app/extension and select your account.

5. The sender can then transfer the NFTs to your address.

That's how you can receive NFTs using Earth Wallet.

:::tip
Instead of copying and sharing your address with the sender, you can just take a screenshot of the QR code shown and send it to the sender, the sender can then scan that QR code which will resolve to your wallet address.
