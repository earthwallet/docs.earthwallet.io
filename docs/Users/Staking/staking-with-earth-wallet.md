10. Go back to the main screen and refresh it by pulling down, to see your updated balance and received staked ETH.

11. Keep in mind, it will only show the updated balance and received staked ETH when the transaction is confirmed, so it can take sometime to appear, but once the transaction is confirmed you will see it on your home screen in Earth Wallet.
