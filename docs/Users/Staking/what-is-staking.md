# Staking

## Introduction
On 15th September 2022, Ethereum shifted to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism from Proof-of-Work. That means ETH will no longer be mined with computational power but through staking. So if you just hold some ETH and decide to stake it (lock it for sometime) you can earn rewards on that.

## What is Ethereum Staking
Staking is a way of earning rewards on the ETH that you already hold by locking it in the ETH 2.0 staking contract.
